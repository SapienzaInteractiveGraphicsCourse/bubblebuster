# bubblebuster
https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/finalproject-jeevana-poonam-airo/
We are developing a game called bubblebuser where our aim is to burst  the bubbles wih the ball by moving the paddle.
here,we have 3 lives and 3 score recordings.
once ball fails to hit the paddle,it means the game is over.
once, ball hits the paddle then bubble automatically gets enlarged.
